Installation
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

First, please do read the license in COPYING.  Then, run

	make
	
and try the program (as root).  If you find it useful,

	make install
	
will install the binary and the man page [0] on /usr/local/ which holds some
info on S.M.A.R.T. too.


Recommended usage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Add the following line or similar to your root crontab entry (obviously
change hda to whatever you use).  This will make sure your hard disk is
healthy each day, and if it isn't crontab will send you mail.

00 07 * * * /usr/local/sbin/ide-smart /dev/hda|grep Failed

WARNING!  shutting down or spinning off after detecting a failure may be
quite dangerous since it is possible that the hard disk will refuse to spin
on again.


[0]  No, no info.. muahahahaha!! ;)
